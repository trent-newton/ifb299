   <h2>Contract Term</h2>
    <p>The term of commitment is on a “per semester” bases, and the contract is to begin upon the commencement of the second lesson, until the last week of classes for the current semester in which the student is enrolled. E.g. Fall or Spring. Every student is afforded the possibility of opting out of lessons after the first lesson, but once the student attends the second lesson, the semester commitment is engaged and financial responsibility for the semester is assumed.</p>
                    
    <h2>Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Lessons are offered weekly in half hour time slots. These slots are scheduled in the first few weeks of the school year, and every attempt is made to schedule the lesson to occur within a student’s free period during the course of the academic week. Occasionally, if there is no suitable weekday time slot available, lessons will be scheduled in the evening or on a weekend.</p>
                    
    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>Payment will be billed home approximately once a month and will reflect the current amount due.</p>

    <h2>Student Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Materials: Students are responsible for the purchase/hire of their own books, instruments, and other materials needed for the lessons they are receiving. Teachers will assist in referring our students to where they can obtain these items, however they are not responsible for providing them personally.</p>
                        
    <h2>Practicing</h2>
    <p>Each teacher instructs how much practice is ideal for each student and will encourage students in their practicing. Nevertheless, once the instructor is gone it is up the student to do her own practicing. Progress will be made most quickly by those students who maintain the recommended practicing time.</p>
                        
    <h2>Attendance</h2> 
    <p>Students are responsible for their class schedules. If a student is not available for their weekly lesson for any reason it is the student’s responsibility to notify the teacher at least 24 hours in advance. If the missed lesson is due to an illness, with a note from the HCC, or another required school function, there will be no charge to the student and attempts will be made to make up the lesson if possible. If the missed lesson is due to any other reason, or the student neglected to give the teacher the required notice, the lesson will be charged, and although the teacher may be able to reschedule the lesson, this is not a requirement.</p>
                        
    <h2>Parent/Student Contracts</h2>
    <p>Students and parents are required to sign the Student/Parent Contract before the first lesson takes place. This student contract ensures that both the students and the parents understand the business arrangements of how these lessons will work. The student contract can be found on our website and can be printed out at home. </p>
